____________

Retro-Rewind is an interactive MERN-stack single-page application that lets the users test their knowledge of Cartoon trivia from the 1990's. The application utilizes a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and Express.js and Node.js servers with a React front end. Colorful graphics greet the users and invite them to answer questions in a multiple choice format within a set timeframe, while a timer counts down to zero.  The user's score is displayed at the end of the set time. 

User authentication on the sign-in page lets game players save their user info and post scores on the high score page. 


Retro-rewind is deployed on Render. See links below.
